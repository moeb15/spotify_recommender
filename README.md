# Spotify Recommender System
For this project I created a recommender system for artists based off of Spotify data.  
The data was sourced using the Spotify Web API, cleaned and validated with SQL, analysis and visualizations  
done using the Python packages Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. Clustering done with the K-Modes model, and  
the web application was built using Streamlit, if you'd like to read more visit my [blog](https://moeb15.github.io/portfolio/).
